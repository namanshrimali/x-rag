Einsum allows computing many common multi-dimensional linear algebraic array operations by representing them\nin a short-hand format based on the Einstein summation convention, given byequation. The details of\nthis format are described below, but the general idea is to label every dimension of the inputoperandswith some subscript and define which subscripts are part of the output. The output is then computed by summing\nthe product of the elements of theoperandsalong the dimensions whose subscripts are not part of the\noutput. For example, matrix multiplication can be computed using einsum astorch.einsum(\u201cij,jk->ik\u201d, A, B).\nHere, j is the summation subscript and i and k the output subscripts (see section below for more details on why). Equation: Theequationstring specifies the subscripts (lower case letters[\u2018a\u2019, \u2018z\u2019]) for each dimension of\nthe inputoperandsin the same order as the dimensions, separating subcripts for each operand by a\ncomma (\u2018,\u2019), e.g.\u2018ij,jk\u2019specify subscripts for two 2D operands.

The exception is if a subscript is\nrepeated for the same input operand, in which case the dimensions labeled with this subscript for this operand\nmust match in size and the operand will be replaced by its diagonal along these dimensions. The subscripts that\nappear exactly once in theequationwill be part of the output, sorted in increasing alphabetical order.\nThe output is computed by multiplying the inputoperandselement-wise, with their dimensions aligned based\non the subscripts, and then summing out the dimensions whose subscripts are not part of the output.
